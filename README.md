Kivy + PyGuitarPro + Spotify + Music Theory

Create a fretboard visualization with a GuitarPro5 file and a Spotify premium account.

Get your Spotify token here: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user/
with user-modify-playback-state scope access. 

Two experimental versions: run kivy_app.py or fretless.py.

Spotify should be actively playing something before running either and pressing
PLAY.
